# CC-together

## About

This repository contains the solutions to CC questions and contests solved by IEEE. We have the following going on right now:

### POD:
- Problem of the day (POD) that is open for 24 hours from 8PM till the next day 8PM.
- POD spans for 5 days from Monday to Friday every week with gradual increase in difficulty level.
- The most optimal and well documented PR would be merged to the main branch!
- Every week, we would cover a topic. This way, solid progress would result in a strong learning curve.

### Weekly contest:
- A hosted contest that covers that week's topic.

### Biweekly contest:
- Attending external contests in platforms like Codeforces, Codechef every 1st and 3rd week.

## Solve with us!
- You can find the POD questions posted in the issues section at 8PM from Monday to Friday.
- For contests, an issue with the contest link will be created prior.
-  Solve the questions, write clear code with comments, create a PR and voila!
